    "Abstract —Active authentication is the problem of continuously",
    "verifying the identity of a person based on behavioral aspects",
    "of their interaction with a computing device. In this study, we",
    "collect and analyze behavioral biometrics data from 200 subjects,",
    "each using their personal Android mobile device for a period of",
    "at least 30 days. This dataset is novel in the context of active",
    "authentication due to its size, duration, number of modalities,",
    "and absence of restrictions on tracked activity. The geographical",
    "colocation of the subjects in the study is representative of a",
    "large closed-world environment such as an organization where",
    "the unauthorized user of a device is likely to be an insider threat:",
    "coming from within the organization. We consider four biometric",
    "modalities: (1) text entered via soft keyboard, (2) applications",
    "used, (3) websites visited, and (4) physical location of the device as",
    "determined from GPS (when outdoors) or WiFi (when indoors).",
    "We implement and test a classiﬁer for each modality and organize",
    "the classiﬁers as a parallel binary decision fusion architecture.",
    "We are able to characterize the performance of the system",
    "with respect to intruder detection time and to quantify the",
    "contribution of each modality to the overall performance.",

    "I. I NTRODUCTION",
    "According to a 2013 Pew Internet Project study of 2076 people",
    "[ 1 ], 91% of American adults own a cellphone. Increasingly,",
    "people are using their phones to access and store sensitive",
    "data. The same study found that 81% of cellphone owners use",
    "their mobile device for texting, 52% use it for email, 49%",
    "use it for maps (enabling location services), and 29% use it",
    "for online banking. And yet, securing the data is often not",
    "taken seriously because of an inaccurate estimation of risk as",
    "discussed in [ 2 ]. In particular, several studies have shown that",
    "a large percentage of smartphone owners do not lock their",
    "phone: 57% in [ 3 ], 33% in [ 4 ], 39% in [ 2 ], and 48% in this",
    "study.",
    "Active authentication is an approach of monitoring the behav-",
    "ioral biometric characteristics of a user’s interaction with the",
    "device for the purpose of securing the phone when the point-",
    "of-entry locking mechanism fails or is absent. In recent years,",
    "continuous authentication has been explored extensively on",
    "desktop computers, based either on a single biometric modality",
    "like mouse movement [ 5 ] or a fusion of multiple modalities",
    "like keyboard dynamics, mouse movement, web browsing,",
    "and stylometry [ 6 ]. Unlike physical biometric devices like",
    "ﬁngerprint scanners or iris scanners, these systems rely on",
    "computer interface hardware like the keyboard and mouse that",
    "are already commonly available with most computers.",
    "In this paper, we consider the problem of active authentication",
    "on mobile devices, where the variety of available sensor data",
    "is much greater than on the desktop, but so is the variety of",
    "behavioral proﬁles, device form factors, and environments in",
    "which the device is used. Active authentication is the approach",
    "of verifying a user’s identity continuously based on various",
    "sensors commonly available on the device. We study four rep-",
    "resentative modalities of stylometry (text analysis), application",
    "usage patterns, web browsing behavior, and physical location",
    "of the device. These modalities were chosen, in part, due",
    "to their relatively low power consumption. In the remainder",
    "of the paper these four modalities will be referred to as",
    "TEXT ,  APP ,  WEB , and  LOCATION , respectively. We consider",
    "the trade-off between intruder detection time and detection",
    "error as measured by false accept rate (FAR) and false reject",
    "rate (FRR). The analysis is performed on a dataset collected",
    "by the authors of 200 subjects using their personal Android",
    "mobile device for a period of at least 30 days. To the best",
    "of our knowledge, this dataset is the ﬁrst of its kind studied",
    "in active authentication literature, due to its large size [ 7 ], the",
    "duration of tracked activity [ 8 ], and the absence of restrictions",
    "on usage patterns and on the form factor of the mobile device.",
    "The geographical colocation of the participants, in particular,",
    "makes the dataset a good representation of an environment",
    "such as a closed-world organization where the unauthorized",
    "user of a particular device will most likely come from inside",
    "the organization.",
    "We propose to use decision fusion in order to asynchronously",
    "arXiv:1503.08479v1  [cs.CR]  29 Mar 2015",
    "2",
    "integrate the four modalities and make serial authentication",
    "decisions. While we consider here a speciﬁc set of binary",
    "classiﬁers, the strength of our decision-level approach is that",
    "additional classiﬁers can be added without having to change",
    "the basic fusion rule. Moreover, it is easy to evaluate the",
    "marginal improvement of any added classiﬁer to the overall",
    "performance of the system. We evaluate the multimodal con-",
    "tinuous authentication system by characterizing the error rates",
    "of local classiﬁer decisions, fused global decisions, and the",
    "contribution of each local classiﬁer to the fused decision. The",
    "novel aspects of our work include the scope of the dataset,",
    "the particular portfolio of behavioral biometrics in the context",
    "of mobile devices, and the extent of temporal performance",
    "analysis.",
    "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In  § II , we",
    "discuss the related work on multimodal biometric systems,",
    "active authentication on mobile devices, and each of the",
    "four behavioral biometrics considered in this paper. In  § III ,",
    "we discuss the 200 subject dataset that we collected and",
    "analyzed. In  § IV , we discuss four biometric modalities, their",
    "associated classiﬁers, and the decision fusion architecture. In",
    "§ V , we present the performance of each individual classiﬁer,",
    "the performance of the fusion system, and the contribution of",
    "each individual classiﬁer to the fused decisions.",
    "II. R ELATED  W ORK",
    "A. Multimodal Biometric Systems",
    "The window of time based on which an active authentication",
    "system is tasked with making a binary decision is relatively",
    "short and thus contains a highly variable set of biometric",
    "information. Depending on the task the user is engaged in,",
    "some of the biometric classiﬁers may provide more data",
    "than others. For example, as the user chats with a friend",
    "via SMS, the text-based classiﬁers will be actively ﬂooded",
    "with data, while the web browsing based classiﬁers may only",
    "get a few infrequent events. This motivates the recent work",
    "on multimodal authentication systems where the decisions of",
    "multiple classiﬁers are fused together [ 9 ]. In this way, the",
    "veriﬁcation process is more robust to the dynamic nature",
    "of human-computer interaction. The current approaches to",
    "the fusion of classiﬁers center around max, min, median, or",
    "majority vote combinations [ 10 ]. When neural networks are",
    "used as classiﬁers, an ensemble of classiﬁers is constructed and",
    "fused based on different initialization of the neural network",
    "[ 11 ].",
    "Several active authentication studies have utilized multimodal",
    "biometric systems but have all, to the best of our knowledge:",
    "(1) considered a smaller pool of subjects, (2) have not char-",
    "acterized the temporal performance of intruder detection, and",
    "(3) have shown overall signiﬁcantly worse performance than",
    "that achieved in our study.",
    "Our approach in this paper is to apply the Chair-Varshney",
    "optimal fusion rule [ 12 ] for the combination of available",
    "multimodal decisions. The strength of the decision-level fusion",
    "approach is that an arbitrary number of classiﬁers can be",
    "added without re-training the classiﬁers already in the system.",
    "This modular design allows for multiple groups to contribute",
    "drastically different classiﬁcation schemes, each lowering the",
    "error rate of the global decision.",
    "B. Mobile Active Authentication",
    "With the rise of smartphone usage, active authentication on",
    "mobile devices has begun to be studied in the last few years.",
    "The large number of available sensors makes for a rich feature",
    "space to explore. Ultimately, the question is the one that we ask",
    "in this paper: what modality contributes the most to a decision",
    "fusion system toward the goal of fast, accurate veriﬁcation",
    "of identity? Most of the studies focus on a single modality.",
    "For example, gait pattern was considered in [ 7 ] achieving",
    "an EER of 0.201 (20.1%) for 51 subjects during two short",
    "sessions, where each subject was tasked with walking down a",
    "hallway. Some studies have incorporated multiple modalities.",
    "For example, keystroke dynamics, stylometry, and behavioral",
    "proﬁling were considered in [ 13 ] achieving an EER of 0.033",
    "(3.3%) from 30 simulated users. The data for these users",
    "was pieced together from different datasets. To the best of",
    "our knowledge, the dataset that we collected and analyzed is",
    "unique in all its key aspects: its size (200 subjects), its duration",
    "(30+ days), and the size of the portfolio of modalities that were",
    "all tracked concurrently with a synchronized timestamp.",
    "C. Stylometry, Web Browsing, Application Usage, Location",
    "Stylometry is the study of linguistic style. It has been ex-",
    "tensively applied to the problems of authorship attribution,",
    "identiﬁcation, and veriﬁcation. See [ 14 ] for a thorough sum-",
    "mary of stylometric studies in each of these three problem",
    "domains along with their study parameters and the resulting",
    "accuracy. These studies traditionally use large sets of features",
    "(see Table II in [ 15 ]) in combination with support vector",
    "machines (SVMs) that have proven to be effective in high",
    "dimensional feature space [ 16 ], even in cases when the number",
    "of features exceeds the number of samples. Nevertheless, with",
    "these approaches, often more than 500 words are required",
    "in order to achieve adequately low error rates [ 17 ]. This",
    "makes them impractical for the application of real-time active",
    "authentication on mobile devices where text data comes in",
    "short bursts. While the other three modalities are not well",
    "investigated in the context of active authentication, this is not",
    "true for stylometry. Therefore, for this modality, we don’t rein-",
    "vent the wheel, and implement the n-gram analysis approach",
    "presented in [ 14 ] that has been shown to work sufﬁciently well",
    "on short blocks of texts.",
    "Web browsing, application usage, and location have not been",
    "studied extensively in the context of active authentication. The",
    "following is a discussion of the few studies that we are aware",
    "of. Web browsing behavior has been studied for the purpose",
    "of understanding user behavior, habits, and interests [ 18 ].",
    "Web browsing as a source for behavioral biometric data was",
    "3",
    "considered in [ 19 ] to achieve average identiﬁcation FAR/FRR",
    "of 0.24 (24%) on a dataset of 14 desktop computer users.",
    "Application usage was considered in [ 8 ], where cellphone",
    "data (from 2004) from the MIT Reality Mining project [ 20 ]",
    "was used to achieve 0.1 (10%) EER based on a portfolio of",
    "metrics including application usage, call patterns, and location.",
    "Application usage and movements patterns have been studied",
    "as part of behavioral proﬁling in cellular networks [ 8 ], [ 21 ],",
    "[ 22 ]. However, these approaches use position data of lower",
    "resolution in time and space than that provided by GPS on",
    "smartphones. To the best of our knowledge, GPS traces have",
    "not been utilized in literature for continuous authentication.",
    "III. D ATASET",
    "The dataset used in this work contains behavioral biometrics",
    "data for 200 subjects. The collection of the data was carried",
    "out by the authors over a period of 5 months. The requirements",
    "of the study were that each subject was a student or employee",
    "of Drexel University and was an owner and an active user",
    "of an Android smartphone or tablet. The number of subjects",
    "with each major Android version and associated API level are",
    "listed in Table  I . Nexus 5 was the most popular device with",

    "minutes. The date and time of the event are not changed but the",

    "of the GPS location data. First, it is relatively unique to",
    "each individual even for people living in the same area of",
    "a city. Second, outside of occasional travel, it does not vary",
    "signiﬁcantly from day to day. Human beings are creatures of",

    "IV. C LASSIFICATION AND  D ECISION  F USION",
    "A. Features and Classiﬁers",
    "The four distinct biometric modalities considered in our anal-",
    "ysis are (1) text entered via soft keyboard, (2) applications",
    "used, (3) websites visited, and (4) physical location of the",
    "device as determined from GPS (when outdoors) or WiFi",
    "(when indoors). We refer to these four modalities as  TEXT ,",
    "APP ,  WEB , and  LOCATION , respectively. In this section we",
    "discuss the features that were extracted from the raw data of",
    "each modality, and the classiﬁers that were used to map these",
    "features into binary decision space.",
    "A binary classiﬁer is constructed for each of the 200 users and",
    "4 modalities. In total, there are 800 classiﬁers, each producing",
    "either a probability that a user is valid  P ( H 1 )  (or a binary",
    "decision of 0 (invalid) or 1 (valid). The ﬁrst class ( H 1 ) for",
    "each classiﬁer is trained on the valid user’s data and the second",
    "class ( H 0 ) is trained on the other 199 users’ data. The training",
    "process is described in more detail in  § V-A . For  APP ,  WEB ,",
    "and  LOCATION , the classiﬁer takes a single instance of the",
    "event and produces a probability. For multiple events of the",
    "same modality, the set of probabilities is fused across time",
    "using maximum likelihood:",
    "H ∗ = argmax",
    "i ∈{ 0 , 1 }",
    "Y",
    "x t ∈ Ω",
    "P ( x t | H i ) ,",

    "where  Ω=  { x t | T current  − T ( x t )  ≤ ω } ,  ω  is a ﬁxed window",
    "size in seconds,  T ( x t )  is the timestamp of event  x t , and",
    "T current is the current timestamp. The process of fusing",
    "classiﬁer scores across time is illustrated in Fig.  3 .",
    "1) Text:  As Table  IIIa  indicates, the apps into which text was",
    "entered on mobile devices varied, but the activity in majority",
    "of the cases was communication via SMS, MMS, WhatsApp,",
    "Facebook, Google Hangouts, and other chat apps. Therefore,",
    "TEXT  events ﬁred in short bursts. The tracking application cap-",
    "tured the keys that were touched on the keyboard and not the",
    "autocorrected result. Therefore, the majority of the typed mes-",
    "sages had a lot of misspellings and words that were erased in",
    "the ﬁnal submitted message. In the case of SMS, we also were",
    "able to record the submitted result. For example, an SMS text",
    "that was submitted as “ Sorry couldn’t call back. ”",
    "had associated with it the following recorded keystrokes:",
    "“ Sprry coyld cpuldn’t vsll back. ” Classiﬁcation",
    "based on the actual typed keys in principle is a better represen-",
    "tation of the person’s linguistic style. It captures unique typing",
    "idiosyncrasies that autocorrect can conceal. As discussed in",
    "§ II , we implemented a one-feature n-gram classiﬁer from [ 14 ]",
    "that has been shown to work well on short messages. It works",
    "by analyzing the presence or absence of n-grams with respect",
    "to the training set.",
    "2) App and Web:  The  APP  and  WEB  classiﬁer models we",
    "construct are identical in their structure. For the  APP  modality",
    "we use the app name as the unique identiﬁer and count the",
    "number of times a user visits each app in the training set.",
    "For the  WEB  modality we use the domain of the URL as",
    "the unique identiﬁer and count the number of times a user",
    "visits each domain in the training set. Note that, for example,",
    "“m.facebook.com” is a considered a different domain than",
    "“www.facebook.com” because the subdomain is different. In",
    "this section we refer to the app name and the web domain",
    "as an “entity”. Table  IIIb  and Table  IIIc  show the top entities",
    "aggregated across all 200 users for  APP  and  WEB  respectively.",
